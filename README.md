# Block 34D - Improved Juicebox

For this project, you will be recreating the Juicebox API from scratch with the new technologies you've learned. You may structure your project as you wish as long as you meet the requirements. Feel free to use one of the previous workshop solutions as reference! Before you start, make sure to read through the rubric to get a sense of what you will be required to do.

## Submission

Please submit a link to your Github repo.

## How to Run the App

To just run the build + server, run:
`npm run dev`

This will rebuild the React files whenever they change, and keep the server running as well, restarting if the server changes.
